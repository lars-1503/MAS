# Add Date of Birth and Occupation Fields to User Entity

## User Story

As an administrator,
I want the user entity to include a date of birth and occupation field,
so that I can store and view additional personal information about each user.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature: Administrator Manages User Personal Information

#### Scenario: Administrator views existing user profile with new fields
```gherkin
Given an existing user "John Doe" with an empty Date of Birth and Occupation
When the administrator navigates to "John Doe"'s profile
Then the administrator should see an editable "Date of Birth" field and an editable "Occupation" field, both initially empty.
```

#### Scenario: Administrator successfully adds Date of Birth and Occupation to existing user
```gherkin
Given an existing user "Jane Smith"
And the administrator is viewing "Jane Smith"'s profile in edit mode
When the administrator enters "1990-05-15" into the "Date of Birth" field
And the administrator enters "Software Engineer" into the "Occupation" field
And the administrator saves the changes
Then "Jane Smith"'s profile should display "1990-05-15" for Date of Birth
And "Jane Smith"'s profile should display "Software Engineer" for Occupation
And the changes should be persistently stored in the user entity.
```

#### Scenario: Administrator adds a new user with Date of Birth and Occupation
```gherkin
Given the administrator is on the "Add New User" page
When the administrator fills in all required user creation fields
And the administrator enters "1985-11-20" into the "Date of Birth" field
And the administrator enters "Doctor" into the "Occupation" field
And the administrator submits the new user form
Then a new user should be created successfully
And the new user's profile should display "1985-11-20" for Date of Birth
And the new user's profile should display "Doctor" for Occupation.
```

#### Scenario: Date of Birth validation - Future Date
```gherkin
Given the administrator is in user edit mode
When the administrator enters a future date (e.g., "2050-01-01") into the "Date of Birth" field
And the administrator attempts to save the changes
Then an error message "Date of Birth cannot be in the future" should be displayed
And the changes should not be saved.
```

#### Scenario: Date of Birth validation - Invalid Format
```gherkin
Given the administrator is in user edit mode
When the administrator enters an invalid date format (e.g., "15/05/1990" or "May 15 1990") into the "Date of Birth" field
And the administrator attempts to save the changes
Then an error message "Date of Birth must be in YYYY-MM-DD format" should be displayed
And the changes should not be saved.
```

#### Scenario: Occupation field length validation - Too long
```gherkin
Given the administrator is in user edit mode
When the administrator enters an occupation string exceeding the maximum allowed length (e.g., 256 characters) into the "Occupation" field
And the administrator attempts to save the changes
Then an error message "Occupation cannot exceed [Max Length] characters" should be displayed
And the changes should not be saved.
```

#### Scenario: Date of Birth and Occupation fields are optional
```gherkin
Given the administrator is in user edit mode
When the administrator leaves the "Date of Birth" field empty
And the administrator leaves the "Occupation" field empty
And the administrator saves the changes
Then the user's profile should be updated successfully
And the "Date of Birth" and "Occupation" fields should remain empty.
```

#### Scenario: Database schema updated
```gherkin
Given the system is deployed
When the user entity is queried from the database
Then the user entity table should contain a column for 'date_of_birth' (Date type, nullable)
And the user entity table should contain a column for 'occupation' (String type, nullable, with appropriate length limit).
```

## Definition of Done: Add Date of Birth and Occupation Fields

### I. Code Quality & Development Standards:
*   All new code is written, reviewed, and approved by at least one peer, adhering to established coding standards.
*   All new or modified code passes 100% of unit tests.
*   No new critical or high-severity issues identified by static code analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube).
*   Code is clean, readable, and well-commented where necessary.

### II. Functionality & Acceptance:
*   All Gherkin acceptance criteria (scenarios) are automated and pass successfully in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   The 'Date of Birth' field is implemented with a strict `YYYY-MM-DD` format and accepts valid dates.
*   The 'Date of Birth' field prevents entry of future dates and provides appropriate validation feedback.
*   The 'Occupation' field accepts alphanumeric characters, spaces, and common special characters (e.g., hyphen, apostrophe).
*   The 'Occupation' field enforces a predefined maximum length and provides validation feedback if exceeded.
*   Both 'Date of Birth' and 'Occupation' fields are correctly persisted in the database upon user creation or update.
*   Both fields are correctly displayed and editable within the user interface for both new and existing user profiles.
*   Both fields are optional, allowing users to be created/updated without providing this information.

### III. Data Management & Persistence:
*   Database schema migrations are created, reviewed, and tested to add the 'date_of_birth' (Date type, nullable) and 'occupation' (VARCHAR/TEXT type, nullable, with appropriate length) columns to the user entity table.
*   Database changes are compatible with existing data and allow for seamless upgrades.

### IV. Performance & Security:
*   No measurable performance degradation introduced (e.g., on user profile loading, saving).
*   Access to these new fields is governed by existing role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms (e.g., only administrators can view/edit).
*   Input validation and sanitization are robust to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

### V. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer:
*   API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) is updated to reflect the new fields in relevant user endpoints.
*   User interface documentation or admin guides are updated to describe how to manage these new fields.
*   Database schema documentation is updated to reflect the new columns and their properties.
*   Any relevant system architecture diagrams or design documents are updated.

### VI. Testing & Deployment Readiness:
*   Successfully deployed and tested in a development environment.
*   Successfully deployed and tested in a staging/UAT environment by relevant stakeholders.
*   All automated regression tests pass in staging.
*   Feature branch is successfully```markdown
