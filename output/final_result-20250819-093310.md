# Add Mandatory Date of Birth and Occupation to User Profile

## üìù User Story

### User Story: Add Mandatory Date of Birth and Occupation to User Profile

**As an** administrator
**I want** the user entity to include a mandatory Date of Birth and Occupation field
**So that** I can store and view additional personal information about each user.

## üöÄ Description

This story aims to enhance the user profile by making Date of Birth and Occupation mandatory fields. As an administrator, this will allow for the collection and storage of more comprehensive personal information for each user, providing richer data for administrative purposes. This applies to both new user registrations and updates to existing user profiles.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario: Successful User Profile Creation with Mandatory Fields
-   **Given:** I am on the user registration page
-   **When:**
    -   I provide a valid 'Date of Birth' (e.g., '1990-01-01')
    -   I provide a valid 'Occupation' (e.g., 'Software Engineer')
    -   I provide all other mandatory user details
    -   I submit the registration form
-   **Then:**
    -   The new user profile is successfully created
    -   The 'Date of Birth' and 'Occupation' are stored in the user's database record
    -   The 'Date of Birth' and 'Occupation' are visible on the user's profile view page

### Scenario: Successful Update of Existing User Profile with Mandatory Fields
-   **Given:**
    -   An existing user's profile does not have 'Date of Birth' or 'Occupation' filled, or they are outdated
    -   I am an administrator logged into the system
    -   I am viewing an existing user's profile edit page
-   **When:**
    -   I update the 'Date of Birth' field with a valid date (e.g., '1985-05-15')
    -   I update the 'Occupation' field with a valid string (e.g., 'Project Manager')
    -   I save the profile changes
-   **Then:**
    -   The user's profile is successfully updated
    -   The new 'Date of Birth' and 'Occupation' are stored in the user's database record
    -   The updated 'Date of Birth' and 'Occupation' are visible on the user's profile view page

### Scenario: Attempt to Create/Update User Profile Without Mandatory Date of Birth
-   **Given:** I am on the user registration/profile edit form
-   **When:**
    -   I leave the 'Date of Birth' field empty
    -   I provide a valid 'Occupation'
    -   I attempt to submit the form
-   **Then:**
    -   An error message 'Date of Birth is required' or similar is displayed
    -   The user profile is not created or updated

### Scenario: Attempt to Create/Update User Profile With Invalid Date of Birth Format
-   **Given:** I am on the user registration/profile edit form
-   **When:**
    -   I enter '15-01-1990' (invalid format) into the 'Date of Birth' field
    -   I provide a valid 'Occupation'
    -   I attempt to submit the form
-   **Then:**
    -   An error message 'Invalid Date of Birth format. Please use YYYY-MM-DD' or similar is displayed
    -   The user profile is not created or updated

<h3>Scenario: Attempt to Create/Update User Profile With Future Date of Birth</h3>
-   **Given:** I am on the user registration/profile edit form
-   **When:**
    -   I enter a 'Date of Birth' that is in the future
    -   I provide a valid 'Occupation'
    -   I attempt to submit the form
-   **Then:**
    -   An error message 'Date of Birth cannot be in the future' or similar is displayed
    -   The user profile is not created or updated

### Scenario: Attempt to Create/Update User Profile Without Mandatory Occupation
-   **Given:** I am on the user registration/profile edit form
-   **When:**
    -   I provide a valid 'Date of Birth'
    -   I leave the 'Occupation' field empty
    -   I attempt to submit the form
-   **Then:**
    -   An error message 'Occupation is required' or similar is displayed
    -   The user profile is not created or updated

### Scenario: Date of Birth and Occupation fields are marked as mandatory on UI
-   **Given:**
    -   I am on the user registration form
    -   Or I am on the user profile edit form
-   **When:** I view the form
-   **Then:**
    -   The 'Date of Birth' field is visibly marked as mandatory (e.g., with an asterisk)
    -   The 'Occupation' field is visibly marked as mandatory (e.g., with an asterisk)

### Open Questions / Findings (from Analysis)

-   **User Story Persona vs. Acceptance Criteria Scope:** The user story is 'As an administrator', but some ACs refer to 'user registration page', which typically implies end-user self-registration. Clarification is needed: Does the administrator create users via an admin interface, or does the administrator define a system-wide rule for all user registrations (including self-registration)?
-   **Missing Date of Birth Validation Rule:** No acceptance criterion specifies a minimum or maximum age validation for 'Date of Birth' (e.g., must be at least 18 years old or cannot be older than 120). This is a common business rule that is currently missing.
-   **Incomplete Occupation Field Validation:** Beyond being mandatory, there are no specific validation rules defined for the 'Occupation' field (e.g., minimum/maximum length, allowed characters, or if it should be from a predefined list). Backend tasks mention 'length constraints', implying such rules are needed but not explicitly in ACs.
-   **Missing Behavior for Existing User Data:** While data migration is addressed in DoD and sub-tasks, there's no specific AC defining the UX or system behavior when an *existing* user accesses their profile *before* these new mandatory fields are populated. Will they be prompted to fill them immediately? How will null fields appear on the profile view page?
-   **Gherkin Syntax - 'Or' in Given Clause:** In "Scenario: Date of Birth and Occupation fields are marked as mandatory on UI", the 'Or I am on the user profile edit form' in the Given clause could be clearer. For better Gherkin adherence, consider splitting this into two distinct scenarios: one for the registration form and one for the profile edit form.
