# Manage User Personal Information

## User Story

**As a** an administrator
**I want** the user entity to include mandatory fields for date of birth and occupation
**So that** I can store and view additional personal information about each user.

## Description

Currently, our user profiles are missing key personal data points that are required for compliance and better user segmentation. This story aims to enhance the user entity by adding 'Date of Birth' and 'Occupation' as mandatory fields, ensuring that all new and existing user profiles capture this information. This will allow administrators to have a more complete view of user demographics and professional backgrounds, which can be crucial for reporting, compliance, or targeted service offerings.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Feature: Manage User Personal Information

#### Scenario: Administrator creates a new user with all mandatory personal information
  Given an administrator is logged in and on the "Add New User" page
  When the administrator provides valid data for "Username", "Email", "Password", "Date of Birth", and "Occupation"
  And clicks the "Create User" button
  Then the new user account should be successfully created
  And the user's "Date of Birth" and "Occupation" should be stored and viewable in their profile

#### Scenario: Administrator attempts to create a new user without mandatory Date of Birth
  Given an administrator is logged in and on the "Add New User" page
  When the administrator provides valid data for "Username", "Email", "Password", and "Occupation"
  But leaves the "Date of Birth" field empty
  And clicks the "Create User" button
  Then the system should display a validation error message for "Date of Birth" indicating it is required
  And the new user account should not be created

#### Scenario: Administrator attempts to create a new user without mandatory Occupation
  Given an administrator is logged in and on the "Add New User" page
  When the administrator provides valid data for "Username", "Email", "Password", and "Date of Birth"
  But leaves the "Occupation" field empty
  And clicks the "Create User" button
  Then the system should display a validation error message for "Occupation" indicating it is required
  And the new user account should not be created

#### Scenario: Administrator edits an existing user to add missing mandatory personal information
  Given an administrator is logged in and viewing an existing user profile that has no "Date of Birth" or "Occupation" stored
  When the administrator navigates to the "Edit User" section
  And enters a valid "Date of Birth" and "Occupation"
  And clicks the "Save Changes" button
  Then the user profile should be successfully updated
  And the "Date of Birth" and "Occupation" fields should now display the entered values in the profile view

#### Scenario: Administrator attempts to update an existing user with invalid Date of Birth format
  Given an administrator is logged in and editing an existing user profile
  When the administrator enters "31/02/2000" into the "Date of Birth" field
  And clicks the "Save Changes" button
  Then the system should display an error message indicating an invalid date format
  And the user profile should not be updated with the invalid date

#### Scenario: Administrator attempts to update an existing user with a future Date of Birth
  Given an administrator is logged in and editing an existing user profile
  When the administrator enters a date in the future (e.g., "01/01/2050") into the "Date of Birth" field
  And clicks the "Save Changes" button
  Then the system should display an error message indicating the date cannot be in the future
  And the user profile should not be updated with the future date

#### Scenario: Administrator attempts to clear mandatory Date of Birth from an existing user
  Given an administrator is logged in and editing an existing user profile that has a "Date of Birth" stored
  When the administrator clears the "Date of Birth" field
  And clicks the "Save Changes" button
  Then the system should display a validation error message for "Date of Birth" indicating it is required
  And the user profile should not be updated (retaining the previous valid value)

#### Scenario: Administrator attempts to clear mandatory Occupation from an existing user
  Given an administrator is logged in and editing an existing user profile that has an "Occupation" stored
  When the administrator clears the "Occupation" field
  And clicks the "Save Changes" button
  Then the system should display a validation error message for "Occupation" indicating it is required
  And the user profile should not be updated (retaining the previous valid value)

## Notes & Potential Improvements (Score: 92/100)

*   **Missing Acceptance Criteria for Occupation Max Length:** While mentioned in the DoD and sub-tasks, the Acceptance Criteria lacks a specific Gherkin scenario to explicitly validate the `Occupation` field against its maximum length constraint. This should be added for comprehensive testing.
*   **Missing Positive Update Scenario for Existing User:** The Acceptance Criteria comprehensively covers creating new users and updating existing users with missing mandatory fields or invalid inputs. However, it lacks an explicit positive scenario for when an administrator updates an existing user's profile (e.g., changing only the email address) where `Date of Birth` and `Occupation` fields are already present and valid. While implicitly covered, a dedicated scenario would enhance clarity for testing.
*   **Clarify Date Format in Acceptance Criteria:** The acceptance criterion "Administrator attempts to update an existing user with invalid Date of Birth format" uses a good example ("31/02/2000"). However, it does not explicitly state the *expected valid date format* (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD or MM/DD/YYYY). Stating this explicitly in the AC would further reduce ambiguity for implementation and testing.
